                    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is used to create and
                        structure content on the World Wide Web. It was first introduced in 2014 as a major revision of
                        HTML
                        to improve the web experience for users and developers.
                        HTML5 offers a range of new features and improvements over its predecessor, HTML4. These include
                        native support for video and audio playback, canvas for drawing graphics, improved form
                        controls,
                        and semantic markup tags that make it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to
                        understand the content of web pages.
                        One of the key benefits of HTML5 is its ability to create rich and interactive web applications
                        without the need for plugins or third-party software. This has made it easier for developers to
                        create cross-platform web applications that work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
                        In addition, HTML5 provides better compatibility with modern web technologies such as CSS3 and
                        JavaScript, which allows for more sophisticated and dynamic web design. Overall, HTML5 has
                        become
                        the standard for web development and is widely used by developers around the world to create
                        websites and web applications.</p>

                        on
                        external servers, or you can use downloaded fonts.
                        Box-shadow: The box-shadow property allows you to add depth and dimension to your website
                        elements.
